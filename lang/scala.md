## 📚 What is Scala?

[Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)) is a modern programming language designed and created by [Martin Odersky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky). The design of the language started in 2001 and was released to the public in early 2004. Martin Odersky had a huge hand in the implementation of javac (the primary Java compiler) and also designed Generic Java, a facility of generic programming that was added to the Java programming language in 2004. This is why it doesn’t come as a surprise that Scala is similar to Java in many aspects, it’s actually written to run in [JVM (Java Virtual Machine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).

## 🤔 Why to use Scala?

- Scala has an exact syntax, eliminating [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code). Programs written in Scala require less code than similar programs written in Java.
- It is both an [object-oriented language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and a [functional language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). This combination makes Scala the right choice for web development.
- Scala uses an expressive typing system that ensures statistical abstraction is secure and consistent.
- It’s easy to learn, especially for programmers with an [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) background with Java or similar language.
- Scala is highly scalable, useful for building fault-tolerant, highly concurrent systems
- It’s ideal for data analytics when supported by tools like [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org)


## 🛠️ Setting up Scala development environment

- Step 1: Verifying Java Packages
- The first thing we need to have is a [Java Software Development Kit(SDK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit) installed on the computer. We need to verify these [SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDK) packages and if not installed then install them. Open the command window and type in the following commands:

- For users using Windows:
`C:\Users\Your_PC_username>java -version`

- Step 2: Installing Scala 
- We are done with installing the [Java SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit). Now let’s install the Scala packages. The best option to download these packages is to download from the official site only: https://www.scala-lang.org/download. 
The packages in the link above are approximately 100MB. Once the packages are downloaded, open the downloaded `.msi` file and install it.

- Step 3: Testing and running the Scala Commands
- Open the command prompt now and type in the following codes:
`C:\Users\Your_PC_username>scala`

- [The Algorithms - Scala](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala)

## 📑 Conclusion

- Scala is a strong statically typed general-purpose programming language which supports both [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions are aimed to address criticisms of Java.
