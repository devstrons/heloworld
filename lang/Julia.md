### What is Julia

Julia is a new, general purpose, high performance programming language with the tagline **"Looks like Python, feels like Lisp, runs like Fortran”** It is easy to use, powerful and extremally performant.

---

### Why to use Julia

- When using Python and other languages in production and environments it becomes sort of a burden and a limitation. While Julia is computationally efficient and easy to use for developers.

- Syntactically Julia is quite similar to python so if, you write code that does very similar stuff to what it does in python, it does faster in Julia.

- You can also embed all python, c, c++, java code directly inside Julia, run that code and interact with output using Julia.

**In Short**

- Open source
- Interoperability
- Reproducible
- Build to be fast
- Well suited for data intensive problems
- Familiar Syntax
- Dynamic and composable

### Setting up Julia development environment

#### On Windows & Mac

##### Step 1:

> Install Julia 

- Download Julia from [here.](https://julialang.org/downloads/) 

##### Step 2:

> Using VSCode

- Install the Julia Extension.

- Create an example file index.jl and start using Julia.

- Write your code and type `julia index.jl` in the terminal to get the output.

#### On Linux

- Open a new terminal and go to your Downloads folder:

```
cd ~/Downloads
```

- Use `wget` to retrieve the latest compressed [Julia Linux Binaries](https://julialang.org/downloads/):

```
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.7/julia-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

- Extract the `.tar.gz`:

```
tar -xvzf julia-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

- Copy the extracted folder to [`/opt`](https://askubuntu.com/a/34922/292615):

```
sudo cp -r julia-1.7.0 /opt/
```

- Finally, create a symbolic link to `julia` inside the `/usr/local/bin` folder:

```
sudo ln -s /opt/julia-1.7.0/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia
```

- Install the Julia Extension on VSCode.

- Create an example file index.jl and start using Julia.

- Write your code and type `julia index.jl` in the terminal to get the output.

### Popular Julia IDEs/Editors

- [Juno](https://junolab.org/) is the most popular IDE for the Julia language. Development focus of Juno has shifted to the [Julia extension for VSCode](https://www.julia-vscode.org/).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Some cool projects in Julia

- [CliMA](https://clima.caltech.edu/) - Climate Modeling Alliance.
- Julia is also excelling in the pharmaceutical modeling space.
- Lots of drug discovery is also happening using Julia fundamentally.
- [Pumas-AI](https://pumas.ai/) developed a revolutionary platform for model based drug development which utilizes the powerful Julia programming language.

### Conclusion

If you are someone who is very interested in the climate space or the medical space then you should go for Julia.
