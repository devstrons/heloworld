## What is Java?
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have 
Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. The compilation of the Java applications results in the bytecode that can be run on any platform using the 
Java Virtual Machine(JVM). Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is 
everywhere!

## What is Java used for?
**Here are some important Java applications:**

- It is used for developing Android Apps

- Helps you to create Enterprise Software

- Wide range of Mobile java Applications

- Scientific Computing Applications

- Use for Big Data Analytics

- Java Programming of Hardware devices

- Used for Server-Side Technologies like [Apache](https://commons.apache.org/), [JBoss](https://developers.redhat.com/products/eap/overview), [GlassFish](https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/), etc.
    
## Why to use Java?
Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages. Java is object-oriented. This allows you to 
create modular programs and reusable code. Java is platform-independent.

Java is a solid core language. Web and non-web environments, all operating systems, all types of devices you’ll find Java everywhere. For those in favor of learning Java 
first, a key factor is that it teaches you to think like a programmer. You’ll learn the language, but you’ll also learn some key underpinnings of programming as well. It’s 
also an object oriented programming (OOP) language. Learning OOP requires students to master a certain level of logic. You have to learn how to think through processes in both
the specific and the abstract. Again, that provides a good base for learning programming in general.

## Tools You Will Need
For setting up environment for performing java codes you need with a minimum of 64 MB of RAM.
You will also need the following softwares :
- Linux 5.14 or Windows xp/7/8/10 operating system
- Java JDK 16
- Text Editors


## Setting up Java development environment
Java SE is freely available from the link [Download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html). You can download a version based on your 
operating system. Follow the instructions to download Java and run the `.exe` to install Java on your machine. Once Java is installed on your machine, you will need to set 
environment variables to point to correct installation directories:

**Setting Up the Path for Windows :**

Assuming you have installed Java in *`c:\Program Files\java\jdk* directory`:*
- Right-click on `This PC` and select `Properties`.
- Click the `Environment variables` button under the `Advanced` tab.
- Now, alter the `PATH` variable so that it also contains the path to the Java executable. Example, if the path is currently set to *`C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32`*, then change your 
path to read *`C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32;c:\Program Files\java\jdk\bin`*

**Setting Up the Path for Linux, UNIX, Solaris, FreeBSD :**

Environment variable `PATH` should be set to point to where the Java binaries have been installed. Refer to your shell documentation, if you have trouble doing this. Example, if
you use bash as your shell, then you would add the following line to the end of your *`.bashrc: export PATH = /path/to/java:$PATH`*.

## Popular Java Editors
To write your Java programs, you will need a text editor, you can consider one of the following:

- IntelliJ IDEA : An IDE written in Java for developing computer software is open source and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
- Netbeans : A Java IDE that is open-source and free which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.netbeans.org/index.html).
- Eclipse : A Java IDE developed by the eclipse open-source community and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/).


## Some Cool projects in Java
- [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-java) : Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
 
- [Universal Image Loader](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader) : UIL aims to provide a powerful, flexible and highly customizable instrument for image 
loading, caching and displaying. It provides a lot of configuration options and good control over the image loading and caching process.

- [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins) : Jenkins is the leading open-source automation server. Built with Java, it provides over 1000 plugins to support automating
virtually anything, so that humans can actually spend their time doing things machines cannot.

- [Plaid](https://github.com/nickbutcher/plaid) : An Android (Java) app which provides design news and inspiration as well as being an example of implementing material design.

- [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) : Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party 
libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.

- [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) : A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android (Java).

- [greenDAO](https://github.com/greenrobot/greenDAO) : greenDAO is a light & fast ORM solution for Android (Java) that maps objects to SQLite databases.
